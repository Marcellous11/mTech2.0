# mTech2.0

Here is my second run at creating a personal website. I've always really liked the aesthetic of the terminal and thought a website with that feeling would be cool. I visited multiple sites for inspiration, and they are all referenced in acknowledgement. Please visit the site and feel free to clone the project, just give me a shout out if you decide to use it!
